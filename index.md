## Project Overview

LUMIN.AI is a project developed by TechLabs Berlin that leverages neural networks to enhance democratic transparency. Our goal is to analyze complex governance data and provide insights into public sentiment, participation patterns, and trust in democratic institutions. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, LUMIN.AI aims to empower citizens and policymakers with actionable information.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understand public sentiment regarding governance issues.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive visualizations to make complex data accessible.
- **Participation Patterns**: Analyze how citizens engage with democratic processes.
- **Trust Metrics**: Measure public trust in institutions and policies.
- **Open Source**: Collaborate and contribute to a project dedicated to transparency.

## Technologies Used

LUMIN.AI utilizes a range of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **AI**: Advanced algorithms for data analysis.
- **Civic Tech**: Tools designed to improve civic engagement.
- **Data Visualization**: Libraries for creating engaging graphics.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks for complex data processing.
- **Democracy**: Focus on democratic governance and transparency.
- **Governance**: Analysis of governance data.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques for predictive analysis.
- **NLP**: Natural language processing for sentiment analysis.
- **Python**: Main programming language for development.
- **React**: Frontend framework for interactive user interfaces.

## Usage

Once LUMIN.AI is running, you can interact with the application through the web interface. Key functionalities include:

- **Input Data**: Upload governance data in supported formats (CSV, JSON).
- **Select Analysis Type**: Choose between sentiment analysis, participation patterns, or trust metrics.
- **View Results**: Access visualizations and insights generated from your data.

### Example Workflow

1. **Upload Data**: Start by uploading a CSV file containing public comments on a recent policy.
2. **Choose Analysis**: Select "Sentiment Analysis" to understand how the public feels about the policy.
3. **Review Visualizations**: Examine the generated charts and graphs to gain insights.

## Data Sources

LUMIN.AI relies on various data sources to provide accurate insights. Some of these include:

- **Public Comments**: Data from government websites and forums.
- **Surveys**: Citizen feedback collected through online surveys.
- **Social Media**: Public sentiment extracted from platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
- **Official Reports**: Data from government publications and reports.
